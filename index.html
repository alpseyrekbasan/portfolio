                My name is Alp. I was born in 1994 in Istanbul. I studied in a German High School and graduated with Abitur. After that I attended School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.
                <br><br>
                I have been working with design from an early age. My first works consist of graffiti drawings and that’s how I got into graphic design essentially. I visited an art studio in Istanbul where I learned the basics of
                drawing and design. After learning traditional methods of drawing I grew an interest in media based art. I produced new media projects that incorporate, sound and video, as well as works that create sound and visuals automatically via
                programming(generative art).
                <br><br>
                Although my most recent works are experimental, I tend to create works that are playful. However that is not the full scope of my practice. I also aim to create evocative atmospheres for viewers and create novel experiences via media
                technologies.
